	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Look at the person on your right and the one on your left. Chances are that one of them is an introvert. Roughly 50% of our entire population is introverted. That means theres a good chance you are too. Don’t worry. Introversion doesn’t mean the stereotypical antisocial and socially awkward definition . According to Carl Jung, a forerunner in modern psychiatry, defines introversion as "<a href="http://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/jung.html">characterized an inward flowing of personal energy - a withdrawal concentrating on subjective factors.</a>” In simpler terms, being introverted means that someone who feels energized by spending time alone. Extroverts on the other hand feel energized by spending time with others. This means that after spending long periods of time with other people, it is typical for introverts to need time to themselves to recharge. Contrary to the popular stigma, introverts are not necessarily shy and many lead great social lives. More characteristic traits of introverts include having a rich imagination, and being reflective and introspective.

<p style="margin-right: 150px; margin-left: 150px;">	<br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp With the recent proliferation of social media, we no longer have to meet face to face with our friends. Be it Facebook, Instagram, or Snapchat, almost everyone we know uses at least one form of social media. Given an introvert’s tendency to require time spent alone, one might wonder about the relationship between the introvert and social media. The general consensus might be that because he needs to spend more time by himself, he won’t be using his social media very often if at all. However, that simply isn’t the case. I believe that introverts, contrary to popular opinion, are more frequents users of social media than their extroverted counterpart.  
	<br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I conducted a survey to try to establish the connection between introversion and social media. In my survey, I asked 5 participants each three questions. First, I asked them to rate how extroverted they are from 1-10. Secondly, I asked them to rate how often they use their social media from 1- 10. Lastly I asked my participants to estimate the number of social media platform they use. From the results of my survey I found that there is no general correlation between introversion and the number of social media platforms. However, astonishingly, I found that the more introverted an individual is the more often he/she checks his/her social media. Upon first discovering this result, I was utterly flabbergasted. Introverted people being more frequent visitors social media than extroverts seemed to go against their very own definitions. I was baffled at what could've been the cause of such shocking results. My sample size could have been too small or my participants may have been biased. I was certain that I had some sort of error until I came across a study done at the University of Alabama. 
 <br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/kDNQ0uC.png?1"></center></p><p style="margin-right: 150px; margin-left: 150px;">
	<br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In the <a href="http://www.uah.edu/news/research/shy-people-use-facebook-longer-but-disclose-less"> study</a>, Dr. Pavica Sheldon from the University of Alabama found that introverts are on social media more frequently while extroverts are more active. This may sound confusing at first but there is a distinct difference between being a frequent user and being an active user. To be a more frequent user means that the user checks his or her social media more often and is on their social media platform for longer durations of time. Dr. Sheldon found that introverted users are on more frequently however the time spent was mostly used as a pass time. This could mean watching videos or looking at other people posts and messages. To be more active on social media means that the user is more likely to post/share information about themselves while on his or her social media platform. Specifically Dr. Sheldon found that the more extroverted someone is the more statuses he or she posts on average. She goes on to elaborate why extroverted people are more active on their social media platforms by explaining that extroverted people are more keen on maintaining their social appearance. She gives an example by stating: “<a href="http://www.uah.edu/news/research/shy-people-use-facebook-longer-but-disclose-less">Posting pictures gives them more control over how they are being presented</a>”(Steele, para. 9). But why are introverts the more frequent user?  I believe introverts are the more frequent users of social media because they have an affinity towards it. 
	<br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In his article “<a href="http://knowledge-leader.colliers.com/how-technology-and-social-media-empower-the-introvert/">How Technology Empowers the Introverted</a>,” Author Shane Stewart states the reason for why introverts are the more frequent users of social media that I strongly resonate with. He states that introverts have a natural connection to social media because it offers “24/7 communication”. He goes on to explain that because introverts normally feel drained after regular social contact, social media provides a convenient alternative. Since social media platforms do not require face to face confrontations and is always available, introverts can now take the time to construct well thought out responses without having the pressure of coming up with one on the spot. Furthermore because social media is available 24/7, introverts now have the option to space out their social sessions into more manageable periods. Previously, when social interaction was solely face to face the options for when to socialize was extremely limited, especially for introverts. This is because face to face socialization generally last for long extended periods of time. Now since social media is constantly on, introverts can simply chose to socialize when they are comfortable rather than when they are obligated to like in face to face confrontations. As a result, they are able to spend more time socializing on social media than face to face. From this we can see that social media is a more intuitive way of socializing for introverts. 
<br><center>	<img src= "http://www.socmedsean.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/social_media_introvert_cartoon.gif"></center></p><p style="margin-right: 150px; margin-left: 150px;">
	<br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Another reason why I believe introverts use social media more often than extroverts is because extroverts have a natural aversion to social media. Extroverts tend to prefer face to face interaction and as a result social media doesn’t necessarily satisfy their desire to socialize. In the article “Introverts Love Facebook and Extroverts Hate It. Here’s Why.” by Ryan Dube, Ryan explains the extroverted psyche: “<a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/introverts-love-facebook-extroverts-hate-heres/">Extroverts, on the other hand, often despise everything about Facebook. The facial cues, the back-and-forth banter and the physical contact are all missing</a> ”(Dube, para. 3). From this we see that for extroverts many of the cues with face to face socialization are missing from socializing in social media. As a result, they are naturally less likely to use social media as a main means of social interactions. Introverts on the other hand have an affinity for using social media. Because introverts feel energized from spending time alone, they can go prolonged periods of time without having to see people face to face (with the exception of close family and friends) and thus are able to rely on social media as a primary means of social interaction.  
	<br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp One possible counterargument lies in the personal narrative “<a href="http://hellogiggles.com/social-media-introvert/1/">The Problem with Social Media as an Introvert</a>" by Sammy Nickalls. In her narrative, she explains how after quitting her job and becoming a freelance writer, she was able to attain an ideal solitary life. Yet despite living the introverted ideal, she repeatedly feels burnt out day after day and is oblivious to the cause. However, one day after posting a tweet on Twitter she comes to the epiphany that social media was actually the cause of her being burnt out. She soon thereafter comes to the decision to take a solid break from social media. One may rhetorically ask: how can introverts be more frequent users of social media if they are prone to burnouts from social media just as they do from real social interactions? The answer lies in adjustable exposure and preference. For introverts, social media has an advantage over real life interaction in that they have a greater flexibility in choosing when they would like to interact socially. As a result, introverts tend have an affinity and preference towards social media as a means of social interaction. However, introverts are still susceptible to being burnt out from prolonged exposures to social media. In Sammy’s case, she was on her social media too frequently and as a result felt constantly burnt out. She states that “<a href="http://hellogiggles.com/social-media-introvert/2/">Primarily, I used to use Facebook all the time for these personal relationships, but since becoming a freelance writer, I’ve become incredibly active on Twitter—tweeting over a dozen times a day, seeing what’s been trending, checking out the latest news stories, keeping up-to-date on the publications I write for, trying to find timely topics to write about and keep myself inspired</a>”(Nickalls, para 1). From this we can see despite not interacting with people in real life socially, her uninhibited amount social media interaction resulted in an overdosage. Thus, while introverts are prone to being burnt out from social media, because it is generally their preferred means of social interactions they can still be more frequent users of social media than extroverts.

	<br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp With the advent of the social media era, we are seeing more and more cases like Sammy's in which people are too reliant on social media. Walking into a Starbucks, we don’t generally see everyone having conversions with one another; rather you would more likely see everyone with this face buried into their screens. Youtuber Gary Turk eloquently articulates our problem with social media in his poem "Look Up." He states:<center><br> "I took a step back and opened my eyes
<br>I looked round and realised
<br>This media we call social is anything but
<br>when we open our computers and it’s our doors we shut
<br>All this technology we have it’s just an illusion
<br>Community, companionship, a sense of inclusion
<br>When you step away from this device of delusion
<br>You awaken to see a world of confusion"</center>
<br> Gary Turk articualtes that message that we, both introverts and extroverts, have been losing our ability to have conversation with each other because technology. Although I found that introverts are the more frequent user of social media because they have a natural affinity, it is no excuse for the deteriorating communication skills ubiquitous throughout society.  I strongly believe that for introverts social media is best in regulated amounts. Too much and we risk burning out and much worse: losing our ability to communicate.
