Flashpoint: “And yet we have sacrificed conversation for a mere connection” Sherry Turkle<br><br>
</b>

	In her New York Times article “The Flight From Conversation”, Sherry Turkle discusses the decline in interpersonal conversation with the advent of phones. Turkle introduces the problem of phone induced communication decline by giving profound examples of it in our daily lives such as texting during a class or a date. The examples she gave served as a great hook to get the reader interested as we have experienced them at some point of our lives. She quotes two brief testaments from a businessman and a teen to emphasize the negative repercussions of the loss of conversation from the internet. She referred to them as the “16-year-old boy” and “a businessman.” Although I generally find quotes helpful, I thought they lacked authority because they seemed so generic and vague to the point that they felt made up. After, she gives the illustrative analogy of how technology has “turned our desks into cockpits” and elaborates on how technology distances us from one another. The metaphor of the desks as cockpits invoked strong imagery while I was reading and helped to get her message across. Her next point was that technology allows us to change the presence we want to portray.  She argues that technology fails to fully substitute the significant role of conversation and trying to replace conversation with technology has negative repercussions. I enjoyed her example of how a high school sophomore would pick artificial intelligence to talk to over his own father as I could easily see myself in the same mindset as that sophomore. She concludes by giving everyday examples of what could be done to counteract the problem. Although I found many of her examples practical, I also found them to be ineffective because enforcing such practices would require a lot of commitment. As a whole, Turkle’s article really convinced me of our loss of conversation as a species due to the progression of technology.

<a href="http://www.socialworktoday.com/archive/051313p10.shtml">Social Media and Interpersonal Communication by Maura Keller</a><br><br>
<b>Flashpoint: Social media’s effect on our ability to interact and communicate is visible throughout all areas of society.</b>
<br><br>

In her article “Social Media and interpersonal communication”, Maura Kelly analyzes the effects of social media on our social skills in real life. She begins by introducing the to reader to a familiar scenario of everyone with their faces buried in their cell phones at a restaurant. I found her scenario compelling because of how relatable it was. It’s so commonplace now in a Starbucks or in any restaurant, for people to avoid conversation because because they are busy looking at their screen.  She then states her main argument: Social media has had a profound effect on our interpersonal skills. It really bothered me how vague her thesis was. I felt that it was a bit too broad and they she could have been a bit more specific with it.  She corroborates her thesis by quoting an assistant professor, Paul Booth. She uses a series of quotes from Booth that state three main ways social media has negatively affected our interpersonal skills. Booth argues that social media has made our conversation too open, less personal and less diverse. I was able to relate to the later two of Booth’s points, however I was lost at what he meant when he said out conversations are “too open.” She then quotes another assistant professor, to argue that the addition of social media has allowed our conversation to have a far reaching effect. The quote elaborates on how the far reaching effects of social media affect bullying: “The bullying messages don’t stay in a particular space, such as a playground, but can now follow the child home”(para. 8, Keller). I appreciated the use of this quote because of how big of an issue cyberbullying has become in the modern age. Her next point argues that social media overloads us with information. With the access to the internet we now have access to much information 20 years ago. She then states that this “information overload” leads to technology addiction. Although i found her point interesting, I did not find it relatable as the terminology that she was rather awkward. Her last argument is that with the advent of social media also comes a lack of privacy. I found her last point the most relatable of all the points because with Facebook so common these days it is uncomfortably easy for the wrong people to obtain someone’s personal information. She concludes, using quotes from Bowman and Booth,  on what might happen in the future with regards to social media. I found the quotes very vague as they mostly just said that social media will become more integrated, without giving definite concrete examples. All in all, I thought the article was a bit too general and scattered. Because of her broad thesis, it felt like she was trying to cover too many bases in one go and tried to squeeze in too many quotes which ultimately detracted from the reading experience.

<a href="http://thedailycougar.com/2013/08/27/run-on-tue-aug-27-social-media-only-provides-a-false-sense-of-socialization-leads-to-depression/">Social media only provides a false sense of socialization, leads to depression by Cara Smith</a>
<br><b>Flashpoint:As a Facebook user, you’re exposed to the best version a person can produce of themselves. Postings of a dwindling GPA or a bad breakup are nowhere to be seen. According to Facebook, these things don’t exist.</b>
<br><br>


In her article “Social media only provides a false sense of socialization”, Cara Smith discusses the illusion of socialization that social media provides and its consequences. She starts off by hooking the reader by stating that Facebook has become society’s “most ironic act.” She then proceeds to explain the irony behind Facebook: In a University of Michigan study the more frequently people check their Facebook the more unsatisfied they are. I found this fact interesting but at the same time expected, as people normally rant and share about their social accomplishments. People who are naturally introverted will feel incompetent in light of their peer’s social accomplishments. She then proceeds to further explain the irony of Facebook, as it was created to break down barriers between people but now it has created barriers. She then proceeds elaborate in the next few paragraphs on the study done in University of Michigan(mentioned earlier) on life satisfaction in correlation to Facebook usage. Although she gave a couple extra numbers than earlier, I felt like much of the information that she conveys was a repeat of what was stated before. She proceeds to explain how Facebook become a breeding ground for showing off accomplishments and how going on would make you feel inadequate. For example she states “Postings of a dwindling GPA or a bad breakup are nowhere to be seen” (para. 11, Smith). I felt that this was obvious as no Facebook user in the right mind would post about  their misfortunes unless they're asking for sympathy. She discusses a study on psychological disorders and Facebook and how 20% people in a study feel anxiety when going on Facebook. On a whole I appreciated her use of studies and statistics as it help bolster her arguments, but I felt that she often repeats the same information and that many of her points were obvious to regular Facebook users.

<h3>Critical Summary 4</h3>
<a href="http://hellogiggles.com/social-media-introvert/">The problem with social media as an introvert by Sammy Nickalls</a><br><br>
<b>Flashpoint: 15 new tweets had popped up on the top of my feed. I felt a lurch in my stomach. Suddenly, I realized that it was social media that was the problem.</b>

<p style="margin-right: 150px; margin-left: 150px;">
<b>Explanation:</b> This is my non-written critical summary. It is my effort to graphically summarize Sammy Nickalls' article on his/her negative experience with social media as an introvert. Every line used in the comic is a quote from somewhere in the article. I greatly appreciated the first person narrative approach that her article gives on the issue of social media and introversion.
