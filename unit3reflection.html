<h1 style="margin-right: 150px; margin-left: 150px;">Due 4/28: Unit 3: Reflection</h1>
<p style="margin-right: 150px; margin-left: 150px;"><small>posted 7:52 PM Monday, April 25th, 2016 (EST)</small></p>
<p style="margin-right: 150px; margin-left: 150px;">
<br>For my unit three project my aim was to translate my essay from unit two into a persuasive visual argument. To give a bit of background, my argument from the second unit revolved around introversion and social media. My paper primarily argued that contrary to popular belief introverted people are the more frequent users of social media. To do this, first I started off my paper by explaining what introversion means and how popular society stigma tends to portray it in a negative light. The I led the reader into the development of my thesis by explaining a short survey that I conducted. In my survey I asked participants to rate how often they use their social media as well as as how extroverted they are. From the results of my survey I found that typically the more introverted people are the more often they are on their social media. This discovery became my main argument. I used a similar study conducted by the University of Alabama to support my argument. I further bolstered my thesis using two papers that sought to explain the phenomenon and by refuting a possible counter argument. Finally, I concluded my paper by stating that even if introverts are the more frequent users of social media it is no excuse for our over excessive addiction and reliance on it. 

<br><br>For my unit 3 project I chose to translate my project into a medium I dub the "powerpoint video." A "powerpoint video" is my attempt to combine both a powerpoint with a video in order to achieve the best of both medias. I will start by explaining why I thought powerpoint presentations were a great medium.  I felt that my original paper was very dense with information, by spreading out the information into powerpoint slides I felt that I would effectively convey the information. Furthermore, with a powerpoint I could include many visual cues to make it more interesting. Powerpoint presentations aren't solely limited to words and pictures, I could also choose to incorporate videos and music is so desired.  Lastly,  powerpoint presentations seemed like a great idea because my targeted audience was the people around me, namely my friends and classmates. By having an interactive and engaging powerpoint I would always be prepared with a visual aide if I ever wanted to share the topic with them. Because I would most likely be sharing about the topic with those immediately around me I felt that powerpoint presentation were the most professional and effective method of conveying my information. I was also heavily influenced by the many TED talks we watched during class. From the TED talks I was able to witness the true ability of powerpoint presentation when presented in front of a real live audience by a eloquent speaker. 

<br><br>One primary reason why I was compelled to use powerpoint as my media is because of a course I took called information presentation (IST 444). In this course we learned about effective methods and techniques of giving presentations and speeches. During the course we particularly covered the difference that sets apart good powerpoint presentations from bad ones. This included habits such as using large font, keeping text to a minimum, and using a lot of visual aides. I also learned that powerpoint presentations were extremely effective when trying to make a pitch or argument for an immediate live audience. Hence I decided that this project would be extremely suitable for applying the knowledge and skills that I gained from IST 444. 

<br><br>Among the many choices of digital media that I had, videos/animations was also a genre that I strongly considered. I believed that videos were a strong candidate because it is the preferred digital media for most audiences as it requires little to no reading. If you asked whether someone would rather watch a video or look through a powerpoint, most people would probably say the video. Powerpoint presentations however become significantly more effective at conveying an argument if the accompanying author is there explaining and going through it. The effectiveness of videos, however, stays roughly the same whether or not the author is there. This is because typically no outside explanation is needed for videos. 

<br><br>In the end, I decided on a compromise. I realized that because a powerpoint was unable to function as standalone and videos aren't as convincing in front of a live audience. Thus I aimed combine the standalone aspect of a video with a powerpoint to create an interactive "powerpoint video." By making all the text and animations interactive, my powerpoint almost works like a video and could be viewed through without excessive reading. But by being present when presenting the powerpoint, I could use my my powerpoint as I would a normal powerpoint. I sought to combine the best of both worlds with my implementation of a "powerpoint video." In essence, my powerpoint video works and functions similarly to an interactive online tutorial. 

<br><br>One quote that really stuck with me and influenced my other units was a quote left by Tia Thevenin on the draft of my second unit project. It reads " My only advice or, constructive criticism would be to find sources such as videos that talk about your counterargument, I know that sure helped me"(Tia Thevenin) During my second unit draft,  the sources that I referenced were solely from online articles. This quote conveyed the message that I should be on the constant lookout for different types of media to incorporate into my projects. By being open to different types of sources, I have access to different references but I end up with a more interesting and diversified project. This quote particularly reminded me that not only is it important to a have diversified sources but having a project with diversified media elements is just as important. From her quote, I have been on the vigilant on how new diversified media could be incorporate into my third unit project.

<br><br>By having a "powerpoint video," I was able to submit my translation both through Facebook and by giving an oral presentation. By having a video aspect to it, I knew that my project would be interesting and interactive enough to view through even if I wasn't there in person with it. Normally if a plain text powerpoint was sent to someone, they would immediately notice the large portions of text and be turned off by it. By having a powerpoint aspect to it, I would be able to use it as a visual accompaniment for an in person speech. Unfortunately, I felt that neither showing my project both in person nor via online was particularly effective. I sent my presentation to around 9 of my friends on Facebook who may have had interest in my topic.  However, outside of the friends already in writing 205 none have replied back. Similarly, my in-person presentations of my topic were also largely unsuccessful. I tried to share my presentations with the friends that I usually spend time, however as I was giving my pitch many of them seemed disinterested and bored. Ideally, I had wanted people to reply to my pitch via email, and be interested and profoundly moved by my live presentation. Sadly I achieved neither. 

<br>In the end, I do not believe this to be the fault of my project medium but rather the reality that my topic may not be as appealing to everyone else as it is to me. In addition, I believe another factor that caused the failure of my submission was the fact that my targeted audience was the people around me, namely my friends. Because they are so often busy with work or in a rush, it's not a surprise that I had trouble keeping their attention and interest. Despite the results, I learned a lot from working on my project and the lessons and skills that I have gain will be invaluable to me in the future regardless of whether or not my peers have enjoyed it.
